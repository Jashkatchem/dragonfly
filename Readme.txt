Hello! 

Inside of this folder is a database named "Dragonfly" after the inn from the hit show Gilmore Girls. 
This database is a simple fictional database of reservations at a hotel that I made in order to demonstrate an understanding of relational databases. 
It has a few different table to table relationships, some basic constraints, and a few roles that make sense in the context of a hotel along wiht their related permissions.
These are: The Admin, Front Desk, and Housekeeping roles specifically.  

You will also see a jpeg of my schema diagram. 

Thanks, 
Joshua Swaby
